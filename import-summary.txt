ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .codepro\
* .codepro\deadCodeEntryPoints.xml
* .idea\
* .idea\.name
* .idea\compiler.xml
* .idea\copyright\
* .idea\copyright\profiles_settings.xml
* .idea\encodings.xml
* .idea\gradle.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml
* OrariProcida2011.iml
* Toc.xml
* default.properties
* orari.csv
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT

Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\commons-net-3.3.jar => app\libs\commons-net-3.3.jar
* libs\json-simple-1.1.1.jar => app\libs\json-simple-1.1.1.jar
* libs\libGoogleAnalyticsServices.jar => app\libs\libGoogleAnalyticsServices.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
